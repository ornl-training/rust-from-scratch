Rust is installed and managed via the rustup tool. Mac and Linux are the preferred system for installing and programming in Rust, but support for Windows does exist.

### Linux and MacOS

Using your terminal, run this command and follow the instructions to install Rust/rustup:

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
